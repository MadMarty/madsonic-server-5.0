  engine allows for the streaming of media that would not otherwise be streamable. The transcoding is performed on-the-fly and doesn''t \
  require any disk usage.<p/> \
  <p>The actual transcoding is done by third-party command line programs which must be installed in {0}. \
  You may add your own custom transcoder given that it fulfills the following requirements: \
  <ul> \
  <li>It must have a command line interface.</li> \
  <li>It must be able to send output to stdout.</li> \
  <li>If used in step 2 it must be able to read input from stdin.</li> \
  </ul> \
  </p> \
  <p> Note that transcodings are activated on a per-player basis from <b>Settings &gt; Players</b>.</p>
